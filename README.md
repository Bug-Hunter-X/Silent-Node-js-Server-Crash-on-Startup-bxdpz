# Silent Node.js Server Crash

This repository demonstrates a common yet frustrating issue in Node.js: silent server crashes upon startup.  The server may fail to start due to issues like a port already in use, but it doesn't provide any clear error messages, making debugging challenging.

## The Problem
The provided `server.js` starts a simple HTTP server. However, if the port 8080 is already in use, the server will crash without outputting any meaningful error to the console.  This silent failure can be incredibly difficult to diagnose.

## The Solution
The `serverSolution.js` demonstrates a more robust approach. By using `server.on('error', ...)` we can handle potential errors during server startup and log useful information. This makes identifying the root cause of the failure significantly easier.
